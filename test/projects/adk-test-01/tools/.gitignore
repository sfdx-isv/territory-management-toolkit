# This file (local-config.sh) is used by the scripts found in ./setup-tools
# to provide customized settings for anyone working on an SFDX-Falcon Demo
# Project.  Because the local-config variables are customized per developer,
# this file should NOT be tracked in source control.
#
# The same holds for any custom libraries that an indivisual developer would 
# like to make.  If you want to build something that wont' be tracked, just
# prepend the filename with "custom_" and it will be ignored.
